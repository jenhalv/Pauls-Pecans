    <h1>Pecan Producers <b>purpose of grafting</b></h1>

    <h3>Grafting a pecan tree is a special technique that helps with variety selection and rapid production.  By grafting the upper part (scionwood/graftwood) of a mature, producing parent tree onto the trunk (root system/rootstock) of another tree, the newly grafted tree will produce nuts that are identical to the parent tree.  The newly grafted tree will also begin producing pecans at a much faster rate. A native tree may not produce pecans for 15 years, but a 8-year-old tree with a graft of a parent tree will begin producing pecans within a few years!</h3>
