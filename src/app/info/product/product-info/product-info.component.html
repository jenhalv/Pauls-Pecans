      <mat-card-title>Storage:</mat-card-title>
      <br>
      <mat-card-content>Although pecans are often described as a semi-perishable product, proper storage techniques must be used to maintain good nut quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pecans that wonâ€™t be consumed immediately will stay fresh well over a year if stored in an airtight baggie in the freezer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pecans can stay fresh for several days at room temperature in open bowls or for weeks if refrigerated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor storage conditions often lead to darkening of the kernel and rancidity of the oils, thus destroying the delicious natural flavor and aroma of the nuts.</mat-card-content>
