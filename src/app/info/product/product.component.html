  <div class="info-title">Our Product:</div>
    <br>
      <div class="info-text">We sell shelled pecans for $15 per pound (pricing subject to change).&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not local, we can ship your purchase via USPS anywhere in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;See our pricing chart below for more details.<br>
      <br>
      Our pecans have been organically grown, handpicked, machine cracked, shelled by hand & rinsed (not soaked).&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose to rinse your pecans again (removing any remaining pecan dust, fragments, & shell particles), let dry thoroughly in a single layer on paper towels before storing them.</div>

  <div class="info-title">Storage Info:</div>
    <br>
      <div class="info-text">Although pecans are often described as a semi-perishable product, proper storage techniques must be used to maintain good nut quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pecans that wonâ€™t be consumed immediately will stay fresh well over a year if stored in an airtight baggie in the freezer.<br>
      <br>
      Pecans can stay fresh for several days at room temperature in open bowls or for weeks if refrigerated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor storage conditions often lead to darkening of the kernel and rancidity of the oils, thus destroying the delicious natural flavor and aroma of the nuts.</div>
